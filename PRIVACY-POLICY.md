Privacy Policy
Introduction
CoronavirusInfoTT is a free mobile application, which serves as a platform for users to receive and track the state of COVID-19 in Trinidad and Tobago. We aim to provide data visualizations to reveal trends in tests, total cases, active cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination numbers from March 2020 â€“ present. If you choose to use our service, you thereby agree our Information Collection and Use policy, as follows:
Information Collection and Use
This app does not collect any user data, as it sets out to provide users with statistical COVID-19 updates for Trinidad and Tobago, through push notifications, its dashboard and data visualizations.
If user data is required in future releases, updated Data Use and Privacy Policies, and their respective consent forms will be disseminated to all users well in advance of the release.
Location Information
The Get Directions feature on our Vaccination Sites page uses Google Maps API, which prompts users to begin their journey based on their currently location, through the Google Maps app. While the device is required to turn on and share location data for this feature, the party which receives this data is not our app, but Google itself. 
Changes to This Privacy Policy
Future releases of new features may be accompanied with updated Privacy Policies.  Users will be able to view updates to our Privacy Policy on this page and will receive push notifications of these changes, on our app. Changes to our Policies will include a date, from which the new policies take effect.
